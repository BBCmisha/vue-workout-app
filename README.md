# Test project for workout tracking

## Description

The test project was created to get acquainted with the interaction with the _supabase_. The structure of the code leaves much to be desired :sleepy:, the components were written quickly, the emphasis was on the logic of interaction with the _supabase_.
This is not an excuse :laughing:
