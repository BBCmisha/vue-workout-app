# Test project for workout tracking

:wrench: Vue 3, Vuex, TypeScript, __Supabase__

## Description

The test project was created to get acquainted with the interaction with the __supabase__. The structure of the code leaves much to be desired :sleepy:, the components were written quickly with one hand and with closed eyes :see_no_evil:, the emphasis was on the logic of interaction with the __supabase__.
This is not an excuse :laughing:

:white_check_mark: Exploring the possibilities of the __Supabase__    
:negative_squared_cross_mark: Code cleanliness
